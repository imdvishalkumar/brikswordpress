When Bricks R Us first entered the engraved bricks market, we noticed that our competitors only sold engraved bricks but didn't help with the campaign itself.

We are the company that changed the industry by creating our services such as Donor Sites, Online Ordering System, Order Form Templates, Brochures, Videos, Webinars and many other <a href="http://www.bricksrus.com/services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">services</a> to help our customers sell bricks.¬† Today many companies have copied some of those services but there's nothing better than the original; we constantly update all of our services to make sure your organization has a successful campaign.¬† We'll even spend time on a webinar to teach all of your staff to go in the right direction and give you our 30+ years of experience.¬† It's nice to have customers but it's nicer to have customers that have made thousands of dollars using our system.

In the beginning, we would celebrate orders of 50 to 100 bricks and now we celebrate orders of 1000's of bricks.¬† Not only do we feel that any order is a good order, we'll treat you the same whether you order one brick or thousands.¬† We would only engrave using the sandblasting method and as we grew, we added laser machines, automation and only the best machines that produce the final product.¬† To this day, we are one of the largest brick engraving companies in the country and we are the only company that does both sandblasting and laser (sandblasting is still just as popular) methods.¬† We have learned a lot as the years continued as we do our best to pass those lessons to our customers.

We started in a small trailer carrying the bricks one by one to be engraved.¬† Our four employees worked hard to get orders out - it's much easier today with our 26 employees and having the ability to automatically upload and engrave our bricks.

When companies grow, many lose the customer service that helped them expand and their products are usually not the same.¬† We have made sure to keep our customer service and products the same as we initially started but we have also made them better and made sure to grow using our experience.

Our lifetime guarantee on our bricks gives our customers assurance they don't have to worry about the engraving and now that we are over 30 years old, we're able to show that we are around long enough should your organization have any problems.¬† We strive to have the best pricing which is why we have a price match guarantee (cannot be combined with any other discount program).¬† We thank you for making us one of the best!

This is why we are "more than just your brick engraving company!‚Äù

<strong>WE SUCCEED WHEN YOU SUCCEED!</strong> When we started this business, brick engraving companies only sold engraved bricks without services. We knew that in order to be successful, our customers had to be successful which is why we were the company that created Donor Sites, Online Ordering System (comes with an Apple or Android app), provided Order Forms and other services that helped our customers maximize their sales.
