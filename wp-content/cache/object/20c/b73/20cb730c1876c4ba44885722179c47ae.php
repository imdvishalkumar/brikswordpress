We knew that in order to be successful, our customers had to be successful which is why we were the company that created Donor Sites, Online Ordering Systems, provided Order Forms and other services that helped our customers maximize their sales.

Read below to learn how we have been able to help customers successfully fund raise with engraved bricks for more than 30 years!
<ul>
 	<li>We uphold the highest expectation of customer service and strive to ensure customer satisfaction at all times.Â  We always answer our phones with a smiling, friendly voice eager to help you with all your brick fundraising needs.</li>
 	<li>We are the only company that engraves on any brick material with our two types of engraving systems:Â <a href="/products/laser/">laser and sandblasted</a>.</li>
 	<li>Bricks R Us can do it all! We are the only brick engraving company with anÂ <a href="/services/online-ordering">Online Ordering System</a>Â that allows you to enter your inscriptions, see all of your current and past orders, print donor reports, capture donor site credit card information, and send thank-you and verification letters.</li>
 	<li>We were the first brick engraving company to offer user-friendlyÂ <a href="/fundraising/donate/">Donor Sites</a>.Â Other companies have since tried to copy us, but Bricks R Us is still the only brick engraving company that modifies the donor site to your specifications, captures all of the information and sends it to the Online Ordering System. We do it all on a secure server.</li>
 	<li>We are the only brick engraving company that will accept your order by any means. Use our online ordering system with the integratedÂ <a href="/brick-creator/">Online Brick Creator</a> or <a href="/contact/">send us your designs by mail</a>. We will always send you a proof sheet before we place any order.</li>
 	<li>We have no limits! We will engrave as many bricks and tiles as you need; whether it be one brick or 20,000+ bricks, we can do it all.</li>
 	<li>We want to make sure our customers can access our website from anywhere and on any device, so we are the only brick engraving company to offer anÂ <a href="/services/brickapp/">iPhone and Android App</a>.</li>
 	<li>Part of organizing a successful brick fundraiser is to have the right tools.Â  To help, we can instantly download Order Form Templates and have us create a <a href="/product/brochures/">Tri-Fold Brochure</a>.</li>
 	<li>We understand that getting donors involved is not an easy task which is why we launched a new initiative to help increase awareness and make your fundraiser a success!Â  We will promote your Donor Site through our various social media channels using a program we call <a href="/services/share-your-cause/">Share Your Cause.</a></li>
 	<li>We are the only engraving company that engraves on any <a href="/products/">brick or tile</a>.Â If we don't have it already, we will either find it or use material you provide yourself.</li>
 	<li>Rush fee? What's that? Bricks R Us will never charge you a rush fee for any order. We will always make sure your order is correct and on your doorstep when you need it.</li>
 	<li>We will price match any other brick engraving company to assure you that Bricks R Us always provides the best product at the lowest prices.</li>
 	<li>Lastly,Â we genuinely care about our customers and want to make sure they will always be happy with the customer service and quality Bricks R Us provides!</li>
</ul>
