Your organization has never been involved in a brick fundraising campaign, and now you are searching for a company that is going to help you. You are trying to find an idea for your organization's committee members to approve, or perhaps you have been assigned the task of finding the right company to take to your committee.

At Bricks R Us, we want to help make that task easier which is why we have set up the ability for all of your committee members to ask important questions, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>How do we start selling bricks?</li>
 	<li>What price should we sell our bricks for?</li>
 	<li>Which bricks should we use?</li>
 	<li>Where should we install the bricks?</li>
 	<li>Should we sell logos?</li>
 	<li>How long should our campaign last?</li>
</ul>
We will assign a web address and provide a phone number for you and all of your committee members so they can ask the questions needed to ensure that your organization is creating your brick fundraising campaign correctly. We will have a moderator provide a presentation about Bricks R Us and the knowledge we have acquired in our 30+ years. Each member will be able to ask questions throughout the presentation so he or she can feel confident about the direction of the fundraiser.

Committee members can be together or at different locations. Through the internet and phone, we will have everyone together for the presentation.

If everyone cannot get together during our regular business hours (M-F, 8:30 am - 6:00 pm), don't worry; we will adapt to your schedule. The presentation can be as short as 30 minutes or as long as 2 hours. The moderator will go at your speed and your schedule.

We know a successful brick fundraiser is important, and the more knowledge everyone has, the higher the success rate!
