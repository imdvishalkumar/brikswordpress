Whether you are looking to give back to the community or donate to a worthy cause, memorial bricks are an excellent way to contribute.

Your contribution to a brick fundraiser will benefit many organizations in need. Not only are brick fundraisers a simple and successful method of raising funds, but they will also create beautiful projects such as new brick sidewalks or walls. Donors, on the other hand, will have the satisfaction of making the fundraiser a success and receive everlasting appreciation from the organization by having their names memorialized in each engraved brick.

Bricks R Us appreciates your contribution to a good cause through the purchase of memorial bricks. The following is a list of organizations for which we have created Secure Donor Sites. We invite you to browse through the list to find a cause to which youâ€™d like to contribute.
