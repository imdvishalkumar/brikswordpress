<p class="justified"><span class="style12"><span class="auto-style1">Bricks R Us wants your brick campaign to be profitable, which is why we want to provide you with as much support as possible. Let us design your Donor Site for free so your donors have the ability to order online. If your organization already has a website, you can just place the link for ordering. The wording can be modified to say anything you want and you can even add your logo and/or pictures. The Donor Site can be designed to direct your customers to send payments to a specified mailing address or by credit card.</span></span></p>
<p class="auto-style2">If you wish, you can have all received orders automatically entered in our Online Ordering System so that you do not have to type anything yourself.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">We do not engrave any orders until you review and approve them; in the meantime, they will remain in your account until you wish to place the order.</p>
<p class="justified"><span class="auto-style1">Do you need to see examples of Donor Sites? Please scroll down this page to view an example of a Donor Site to manage a brick campaign.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style5">Bricks R Us is the company that created Donor Sites so customers can have an online presence to help sell more bricks. Other companies have copied the idea since but there is nothing like the original.</p>
