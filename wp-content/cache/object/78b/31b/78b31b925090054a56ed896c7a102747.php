We can offer this guarantee because of our years of experience, our state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment and our highly trained staff.

In fact, in the over 30 years we have been in business, we have <strong>never</strong> had to replace any of our custom engraved bricks due to cracking or any degradation to the engraving from our process or due to weather.

If for any reason you are not satisfied with your Bricks R Us product, we will gladly replace it at no charge (so long as the bricks/tiles were not broken on site).

Since the paint used on each brick can erode due to poor maintenance and Bricks R Us has no control over how the bricks are treated, we cannot guarantee the paint within the bricks.Â  If you follow our <a href="/cleaning">cleaning instructions</a>, the paint will last.

In addition, we offer a <a href="/services/lowest-price/">Lowest Price Guarantee</a>. If you find lower-priced custom engraved bricks with a competitor, weâ€™ll match that price. Itâ€™s our way of ensuring that you receive the lowest price for your engraved brick project and ensuring that your non-profit receives the maximum amount of proceeds.

Bricks R Us is committed to making you 100% satisfied with your products. We want to help your organization make a difference with quality products and with our ongoing support.

If you are looking for a way to fundraise for your non-profit organization and would like to know how to use custom engraved bricks to raise funds, contact us today. Our phone number is 888-MY-BRICK or you can email us through our <a href="/contact/">contact form</a>.

One of our representatives will be happy to speak with you about fundraising. We have all the tools you need to plan and execute a successful fundraiser for your organization!";s:10:"post_title";s:9:"Guarantee";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:9:"guarantee";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2019-09-23 11:43:06";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2019-09-23 15:43:06";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:9;s:4:"guid";s:37:"http://www.bricksrus.com/?page_id=463";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"page";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";}}
