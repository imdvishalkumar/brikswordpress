In fact, it is part of what separates us from other brick companies. That is why weâ€™ve created the Brick Rewards Program for our customers in need of engraved bricks. Itâ€™s our way of rewarding you for rewarding us with your business. We wouldnâ€™t have it any other way!
<h2>Here's How It Works!</h2>
For every brick purchased, you will receive one reward point. Start receiving your discount rate after accumulating 501 points.Â  Reward points donâ€™t have an expiration date!Â  Points are rewarded by tiers, example: 760 reward points provides 250 points at 2.50% and 160 at 3.50%.

After reaching a certain number of points (see chart below), your account will automatically start to qualify for a permanent discount. The more you order, the larger the discount! Thatâ€™s extra savings for you and your organization to put toward your fundraising project. You wonâ€™t find savings and rewards like this anywhere else!

When you log into the Online Ordering System, your points will be displayed.
