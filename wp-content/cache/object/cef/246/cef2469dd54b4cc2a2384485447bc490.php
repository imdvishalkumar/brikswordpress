A brick engraving fundraiser certificate is a great way to say thank you to a donor and show them that you appreciate their commitment to the cause. Each Donor Certificate is laser-printed on heavy ivory paper and is personalized to each donor with a red brick engraved with the donor's inscription.

* Please be aware we are only able to print text on the certificates. At the moment we cannot print any logos or symbols.

* Certificates are printed by a professional printing company for a quality finish.

Building a successful brick fundraiser is no easy task. Between planning for the fundraiser, organizing the events and engaging enough people to donate to the cause, a brick fundraiser is time-consuming. At the end of the day, though, there is no better feeling than knowing your fundraiser accomplished what it was meant to do. And while there is a lot to be thankful for, one can never forget the people that made the fundraiser a success â€“ the donors!

No amount of organizing and planning would matter if no one donates to your brick fundraiser. Thus, you always want to say thank you to your donors for their contribution. This display of gratitude goes a long way in showing your donors that their donations helped make the fundraiser a success. <a href="https://www.bricksrus.com/contact/">Contact us</a> today to learn more about purchasing certificates!
