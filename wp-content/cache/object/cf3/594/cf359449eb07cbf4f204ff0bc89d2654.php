Why do so many organizations use Bricks R Us instead of other engraved brick companies? It's our free services, customer support, high-quality products, and the tools that we provide to assist them in having a successful campaign. We list all of our prices - no surprises! Read on to learn why you should be working with us!
<h3>We Walk You Through the Brick Fundraising Process</h3>
If an engraved brick fundraiser is new to you, contact one of our <a href="/contact/">customer service representatives</a>. The Bricks R Us team will guide throughout the entire process, so you will not feel like you are doing this alone. Organizations and companies depend on the money received from engraved bricks to pay for needed items and we take that very seriously. We will ensure you are comfortable with this type of fundraising at all times. If this isn't a fundraiser, we will still provide the tools and knowledge to help you organize your project.
<h3>The Advantages of Using Engraved Bricks</h3>
You determine the price for which each individually personalized engraved brick or tile will be sold. Bricks R Us will provide you with our low net price per inscribed item. The difference between those two costs is the direct profit to the charity or project of your choice. Best of all, your donor's name or inscription is literally "set in stone" for a lifetime.

Personalized engraved bricks or tiles can be installed in many places, affording you the opportunity to get creative with your fundraising campaign. Without any upfront costs or leftover inventory, a brick fundraiser provides you and your donors with an affordable way to raise money. In addition, a brick fundraiser can be ongoing for years if you wish. As a result, youâ€™ll have a permanent memorial from your donors to your organization.

How much money can be raised? Bricks have sold for $50 to $1,000. Remember, your cost stays the same.
<h3>Bricks R Us Offers More Than Just Brick Engraving</h3>
Bricks R Us services extend beyond our engraving capabilities. We've created consulting services to ensure the success of your campaign. These include marketing, public relations, order forms, mapping and tracking systems, an array of sales-related services, and an <a href="/services/online-ordering/">online ordering system</a>.

Personalized engraved bricks and tiles by Bricks R Us, in the shape and size of your choice, can help you raise funds and provide donor recognition at the same time. We offer a wide variety of type, design styles and letter sizes. They are available to engrave on clay or concrete bricks, tile products and even benches! This creates a truly distinctive look that is tailored to an exciting and meaningful project. The purpose is valid, the method is easy, and your profits are great!

Charities, religious institutions, hospitals, animal organizations, government buildings, schools and colleges, and civic organizations can benefit from this proven method of painless fundraising.
<h3>You Can Expect Outstanding Customer Service</h3>
We believe that our customer service is what sets us apart from any other company. Raising funds using engraved bricks is an easy way to raise money as long as you have the right support group. This is why we have our 24-hour policy - since we strive to give you the best customer service available, we will always respond to your phone calls or emails within 24 hours.
